# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to assist Steve in his mission to manage the stocks investments of his parents. They are passionate about green energy and want to invest in it, but have not conducted much research regarding which green energy stock to invest in. Steve has provided an excel file containing the stock data to be analyzed.

## Results

### Results of Stock Performance between 2017 and 2018

There is minimal difference between the stock performance between 2017 and 2018. The percentages under the "Total Daily Volume" columns all look nearly indentical, as shown in the images below

## Summary

1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

One advantage of refactoring code is that it cleans up the current code one may have written, and thus made it easier for someone else to read through and understand what was done.

Another advantage to refactoring is that it shortens the amount of time it takes the computer to process the code, thus making the coder overall more efficient.

A disadvantage to refactoring code is that it is adds another step for the coder or team of coders to take. A certain sequence of code may be perfectly functional, and to have to go back and refactor may result in a large time commitment that perhaps would be better off left alone.

2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Due to the nature of the VBA languague, it can be dificult to understand what is going on in someone else's code, even when there are comments injected throughout. By refactoring one's code, one can not only make it easier to understand, but also make to computer more able to compute the code. At the same time however, the process of refactoring takes time. If a code already works then perhaps there is no need to refactor.
